A simple program to show how multilevel inheritance occurs. In this program the base class is student in which we make functions to get & print name, rollno. Then we create another class marks derived from student class & visibility mode is set to be public. This class is used to get & print marks of the student. We inherit another class from marks known as result (hence multilevel inheritance). This class calculates and print the result of student.
